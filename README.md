# VIZUO
VIZUO is a web application with interactive animations that showcase how sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and depth first search algorithms work. These visualizations allow you to better understand how these algorithms operate and how they differ from one another. 

The visualization tool is implemented using JavaScript and will enable users to visualize various sorting and searching algorithms, including bubble sort, quick sort, binary search, and linear search. It will also incorporate DFS-based algorithms for maze generation, such as recursive backtracking, which will allow users to generate and visualize complex mazes. The project will focus on providing a user-friendly interface that will enable users to interact with the visualization tool easily. 

Overall, the DSA visualization tool will help students and developers better understand how sorting, searching, and maze generation algorithms work in practice. It will serve as a useful educational tool for those learning DSA concepts and as a reference tool for developers implementing these algorithms in their projects.
